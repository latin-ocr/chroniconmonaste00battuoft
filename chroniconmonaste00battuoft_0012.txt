viii PREFAGE.

the more patriarcha] government of the Anglo-Saxons
—more mild as it was more religious in its character—-
the power of the Prince was a reflectiOn of the. power
of the Lord3 it was in a manner derived from him, as his
was from the father of the family. Each great landowner
formed a centre round which his tenants and his vassals
gathered3 each one had little or no connexion with
other Lords, no systematic form, 110 clear line of de-
marcation defining the just limits of ecclesiastica] and lay
jurisdiction‚ for no such necessity existed. But it was far

and visible head. Were this the place for such details, it

might easily be shewn that these remarks apply with equal
justice to the ecclesiastica] as well as to the civil power.
And how thoroughly the Norman Kings had learned to
persuade themselves of the truth of it, how well they had
conned their lesson, might be further shewn by reference
to the acts of their reigns, and from the History now be-

it, to the remarkable conference held before Henry IL,
when these new opinions, to which the troubles of Ste-

riously argued.

It was not to be expected that the principles thus pro-
mulgated by the Norman SovereignS‚ and upheld by them
with so much tyranny and oppression, should not, sooner
or later, be turned against themselves, even had their
reigns been less marked than they were with violence and
