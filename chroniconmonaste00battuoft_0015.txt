better testimony from the records of the Monks themselveS.
A slight inspection of the names of the different brethren
will be sufficient to prove that they were, with scarcely
an exception, of Anglo-Saxon origin. We may add to this
the practice common in earlier times, at least, of choosing
the new'mOnks from among the tenants of,the religious
houseS, who were also exclusively Anglo-Saxons. We
may also add the fact of their being no better fed, or clad,
or educated than the sons of the farms from which they
were taken. Chosen, then, from the popular classes, and
associated with them to a great degree in popular feel-
ings and prejudices, they were the natural guardians and
protectors of the labouring classes. Their proceedings
in the assertion of their own independence was a popular
cause. Besides, while the Bishops were employed about
the Court, the Monks resided in the middle of their
estates3 while the Prelates were employed in matters of
state, the Monks had the education of the people. The
demand made by monasteries for various excellence and
skill promoted various kinds of learning, and fostered
genius in all its branches. It tended to the gradual
amelioration of the lower orderS, it prevented a relapse to
barbarism and infidelity,—-to the state of torpor amount-
ing to brutality‚ which had formerly prevailed in Eng-
land,—a torpor which must have returned again, but
for the continual spur to exertion‚ the continual reward
for genius and talent, supplied by the religious houseS.
We are not to be surprised, then, that, in their struggles
for independence, and in the second step consequent upon
it, wealth and power to carry out their intentioris and
principles, these houses were greatly favoured, not only by
the people at large, but even by the Norman Barons. Po-
litic principles would induce many to do this3 they would
