xii PREFAoE.

consider that the struggles of the Monks against the
Bishops was their own cause, that they were fighting the
same battle in which the laity themselves were engaged.
The cause of the monkS, though in reality, at first, the
cause os the people‚ would appear to the Norman nobles in
a far different light3 and thus these nobles helped forward
the aggrandisement of the monkish orderS, in many in‘-
stanceS, from policy——in some caseS, undoubtedly, from

the laity, but in times of lawlessness and oppression they
were a living lesson of the blessings of obedience, and of
the value of discipline. They were a living lesson among
laymen of the reality of spiritual things, In their posi-
