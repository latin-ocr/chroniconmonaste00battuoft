his brother Roger is to make his appearance at Battle‚
and return the charter of confirmation to the convent,

but is prevented by death, 128.— Upon this, Alan de

· Bellafago breaks the terms of the composition, usurps

the church of Brantham, and owing to the intervention
of friends and the death of Abbot Walter shortly after,
enjoys it several years.

The Writer’s remarks upon Abbot Walter's zeal and
prudence in recovering these churches—-thinks that the
difficulty of the task was increased by the circumstance
that the lords of the manors laid claim to the right of
patronage over those churches which were situated in
their estates—would have preferred it, had the Abbot
appointed vicars (according to the modern system), in-
stead of taking pensions, which he might easily have
done, owing to his influence with the King, 130.—-The
sum total of these pensions was twenty-two marks silver.

The Abbot appoints a moiety of the tithes at Wi for
the sacristy at Battle‚ and a certain portion of white wine,
spice-cakeS, and simeneIS, &c., for his anniversary3—so-
lemnly anathematizes any that should infringe this order,
131.

Two milites give to the convent two portions of land
near Bodeherste—purchase a parce] os land and a right of
way for their estate near Bodeham, 132.-—St. Martin’s
deprived of the honour intended it by Heaven, owing to
the irreverence of the people of Battle‚ 133.-This honour·
is transferred to St. Nicholas‚ Exeter, 134.

Character of Abbot Walter—careful in his pastoral
charge, in attending the sick and the leprous, 135.—
Looks after the estates belonging to the convent—prac-
tises hospitality—visits the manors in distant parts—en-
riches the church—provides new vestments —builds the
cloister—is taken ill at his manor of Wi—account of his
last sickneSS, 137. —Visited by the convent—by his
brother—carried to Battle—laid in the chapter on sack-
cloth and asheS, 138,—His benefactionS.
