53, v. 13, judicio aquoe. Spelmann, in his Glossary, pp. 326.
435, gives instances of the right of ordeal by water,
as well as otherwise, being conferred upon monas-
teries by the Kings of England3 but the fact of its
being attached to the manor of a subject is strange,
nor can I find any other instanceS.

65, v. 6, it is somewhat remarkable that the Chronicler should make
no further mention of the govemment of his house be-
tween A. D. 1135—1139. Abbot Warner resigned
in the fourteenth year of his government, that is,
1139. However, in the year 1138, according to
John of Hexham, Cardinal Albericus gave the bene-
diction to the ,new abbot of Battle, named Adanus, of
whom I 0311 find no other notice. His words are
these: “ Abbatiae quae est juxta Hastinges, quae
dicitur ad Bellum, abbas nomine Adanus electus est,
quos utrosque praedictus Albericus benedixit.”—Spel-
mann's Cone. ii. 42.

65, v. 16, Abbate S. Albani.—See Newcome’s Hist. of St. Al-
ban's, p. 53.

66, v. 6.-See The Ancient Laws and Institutes of England.

67, v. 17, eo tempora—See Spelmann's Ooncilia, ii. 53.

84, v. 12, myra, called in the ancient records Aungre, now On-
gar, in Essex. The hundred of Ongar was given by

Henry 11. to Richard de Luci, and with it the castle .ῑ.
and honour of Ongar. It is not a little singular, that ,1 J
the church‚ a very early erection, was dedicated to >

St. Martin.-—See Wright's Essex‚ ii. 327.

108, 5, sigillum—On the use of seaIS, more especially by private .ss V

persons, see Dugdale's Warw. p. 672.

113, v. 9, Robertus, &c. Crepito Corde is mentioned as a bene· ,J ⁷

factor to the Church of Rochester in Thorpe’s Reg.

Roff. p. 209, and elsewhere. So also is the name of ;

Will. de S. Leodegario, spoken of at p. 54.

122, 25, filium. This mention of a priest's son, and of his succeed- j Ι
1118 to his father's living, may perhaps seem strange: ψ 2
