—The monks find that opposition is of no avail, and make a
new choice.—They fix upon Odo, Prior of Canterbury, then
just come to the court on business connected with his con-
vent—the King and the Archbishop commend their choice,
149- and send for Odo—-the Prior is introduced with
great honour—is seated between the King and the Arch-

in his denial, notwithstanding the persuasions of others,
152.—When the King and the Archbishop urge him to
comply, requests time for deliberation, but this is refused

exemption from obedience to Canterbury—he refuses the
exemption —the Archbishop grants it, and gives him
benediction.

'Odo takes his way to Battle, 159.-Is introduced into
the chapter—ceremonies of this introduction—addresses
the monks on the occasion—-enters on his office, 160.—In
the meantIme the Dean of Chic'hester and others arrive—
demurs to receiving his benediction from the Bishop, 161.
