with few exceptions, the prosperity of the hierarchy and
of the monastic orders was a common cause, and at
this time neither of them had reason to be jealous of the
other.

The reign of Stephen and the troubles consequent
upon its disturbances, raised the nobility, both eccle-
siastical and secular, to a degree of importance never en-
