proctor—the opposing party failing to appear, sentence is
given in favour of the abbey, 115.—The church is con-
ferred on a clerk named Robert Philosophus, to be held
on the payment of an annual pension.

The Abbot proceeds to substantiate his right to a pen-
sion from the parsonage of Trilawe‚ withheld by Roger, the
incumbent.—After Roger’s death, one Haymo Peccatum
claims the right of patronage, and bestows it on a clerk
named William de Orbec, 116.-The Abbot failing to
obtain his rights from the civil and spiritual courtS, appeals
to Rome—obtains a letter from the Pope to the Bishop
of London, demanding instant restitution, si super clerici
in ecclesiam intrusione constaret, 117.—The parties being
summoned to appear at St. Paul’s, sentence is given for
the Abbot, who bestows the patronage on Robert Phi-
Iosophus.

At Robert’s death William de Orbec is again intruded
into the living by Haymo Peccatum—the Abbot brings an
action against him, 118.—The parties are summoned to
appear at London, but upon the latter alleging his in-
ability to appear, by reason of his sickness, a new trial is
appointed at Northampton3——the Abbot appears by one of
his monks named Osmund—Haymo by his son Geoffry—
Haymo foregoes his claim, and William de Orbec resigns
the church into the hands of the Bishop of Norwich, 119.

The Abbot now turns his attention to improving the
pensions from the churches in Norfolk and the counties
adjoining--which pensions, amounting to ten shillings per
annum from each church, were called by the ambiguous
term decimas, 120.—Owing to their distance from Battle,
and other causeS, these pensions were seldom paid; and, as
the expense of collecting them exceeded their value, the
convent presented these churches to Richard de Bellafago,
Archdeacon of Norwich, on condition of his being respon-
sible for the due payment of all the annual pensions.—On
Richard’s promotion to the see of Norwich, his son Alan
usurps one of these churcheS, named Brantham, 121—-
