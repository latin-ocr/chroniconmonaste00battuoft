But we must draw these remarks to a close3 and we do
so with a hope that men will learn to look upon these
questions with feelings less influenced by prejudice3 that a
more even-handed justice will be dealt out to a body of
men whom it has long been a fashion to abuse, and to re-
present as the great foster-fathers of idleness and luxury.v
Three centuries have passed away, and yet they have left
their trace and influence even on this age—how different
from their own! Even in these days of utilitarianism and
expediency, men are cons-trained to go on pilgrimage to

Haeften quotes an instance of the
Abbot of Turin (in Taurinis), as
early as the year 531, carrying off
into a place of security as many as
6700 MS. volumes, a ta time when
an invasion from the Saracens was
