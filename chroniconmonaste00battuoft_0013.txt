and its resultS, rendered such a consequence inevitable.
No intelligent reader of the history of the Middle Ages can
fail of perceiving that the policy of the Holy See, whether
intentional or not, tended to the restriction of regal power,
and the emancipation of the middle orders of the community.
The mediatorial position of the Sovereign Pontiff, as the
arbiter of peace and order, pointed inevitably to such a
result3 and what he was as universal bishop to troubled
Europe, such was each particular bishop in his own sphere
and diocese.

The Norman Bishops were the maintainers of peace and
order. For the security of his kingdom, the Conqueror
found it necessary to invest them with an authority suffi-
cient to countervail the most powerful of his Barons. A
power thus created was not to be destroyed at the will of
its author, especially when the necessity for it had not alto,-

tended naturally to strengthen it. With such a King as
William IL, and such an Archbishop as Anselm, men
could not but wish the kingly power repressed, and the
powers of the Church enlarged. Earnest-minded men
could feel no misgiving in the exaltation of that power,
whose officers the prophet had declared should be peace-

exactors of right and the only guardians of peace in those
generations. It was in vain, therefore, in this King to
scorn and jest at it, when in his heart he secretly feared
it; it was in vain, too, that Stephen, hampered by the
troubles of his reign, at one time courted, and then again
tried to repress it. In the time of Henry ΙΙ., notwith-
standing the activity and policy of that Prince, it was far
more advanced at the conclusion, than it had suffered
diminution at the commencement of his reign. It might
indeed be considered as fairly and fully established.

At the same time, while the ecclesiastica] jurisdiction
