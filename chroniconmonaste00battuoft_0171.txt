MONASTERII DE BELLO. 129

   

totius corporis pars est dignior, amplioris se juris ple-
nitudinem in ecclesiis quam in territoriis, in quibus sitae
sunt, habere affirmabant. Sed abbas se in omnibus pro
domo Domini scutum viriliter opponens, singulas de*
singulorum unguibus magna tamen cum difficultate ex-
torsit, et juri monasterii sancti Martini de Bello restituit.
Providit itaque in omnibus honori et utilitati commissae
sibi ecclesiae, licet a quibusdam modernioribus putetur
eum in ipsarum ecclesiarum revocatione prudentius egisse
potuisse. Dicitur enim quia si tunc, temporis omnimodis
institisset, ipsas ecclesias cum fructibus omnibus ex eis
provenientibus in usus monasterii sui transferre potuisset,
institutis per eum vicariiS, qui in ipsis sub annua et ho-
nesta mercede ministrarent.¹ Putatur autem tunc tem-
poris id potuisse, quippe cum dominum regem haberet
admodum benivolum, per quem et haec et ampliora a sum-

priatibns, p. 26. As early as the
year 1106, Gundulph, Bishop of
Rochester, granted leave to the
monks of St. Andrew's to appoint
vicars in various churches, on eon-
dition, of the reservation of certain
payments in kind to him and his
successors. Reg. „Roffens., p. 6,

² These possessions always
proved a source of great trouble
10 the monastic orders. Whether
managed by an advocate, or by
the abbots themselves, in earlier
times, or, at a later period, by
monks appointed for the purpose,
they produced most evil effects,
and plunged their owners into the

cloister to the court. If the estates
were managed by advocates, those
who should have been the defend—
ers, became too frequently the
greatest oppressors of monastic
rights, and betrayed those whom
they should have defended ; if by
the abbots or priors, the discipline
of the house was relaxed by the
absence or secular occupation of
its proper head ; if by monks, the

their order, or sent to examine
the condition of their estates, they

monastic life, or carried back to
the cloister the corruption and
vices which they had learned in
the world. It would not require
any very great research to show
that these were some of the influ-
