X PREFACE.

asserting its own independency, whilst it was exerting its
influence in checking despotism and preserving and foster-
ing the elements of civilisation, there was growing up
within itself a new element of power, destined to check
and control the prelacy—I mean the increasing impor-
tance of the Monastic Order. The ascendancy of the
one order would naturally tend to the advancement of the
other. For in the growing worldly pomp and splendour
of the Church, it was natural to expect that communities
of men living in evangelical poverty, and professing a
life of austerity and sels-denial, should meet with encou-
ragement and a great share of popularity. As the higher
clergy occupied the more exalted stations in society, and
were identified with the court, it would naturally follow,
that the monastic bodieS, taken from the lower orders of the
people, should be identified with a popular party, and lead
the way in those struggles for independence which were
afterwards taken up by the Commoris,

Thus, then, were the M onastic Orders appointed to be
the instructors of the great masses of society, and to lead
them on the road of improvement and independence.
Thus were they destined in earlier times to occupy that
position as an ecclesiastica] body, which was afterwards
held by the third estate (as it is called), the cradle of social
life and liberty. With some reason, therefore, does a mo·-
dern writer of great intelligence behold in the advance-
ment of these orders a type and example of the struggles
of the Commoris, At all events, at the period of which I
am now speaking, it is not to be questioned but that
the Monks represented the popular ecclesiastical party in
England, and what the great mass of the people were to
the Norman Barons, the same were the Monks to the
more dignified ecclesiastiCS.

For this popularity os the Monastic Orders we have the
direct testimony of a Norman historian.¹ We have even a
