BROWNE WILLIS’S HISTORY OF MITRED ABBIES.

“Kmo WILLIAM the Conqueror, A. D. 1067 (and
not Α. 1). 1086, as it is in the folio edition of Stow’s
‘Annals’), built an Abbey in the same place where he
fought and overcame Harold and his army. His design
in building this Abbey was, that perpetual praise might
be given to God for the said victory, and that prayers
might be offered for the souls of such as were slain here.
It was dedicated to St. Martin, and was endowed at the
Dissolution with lands valued at 8805. 143. 7d. per ann.
Dugd.—987c. Os. llssd. Speed.

“ In this battle, it is said, above ten thousand men

lost their lives on the conquering side; but what the
number ofthe vanquished was may be guessed at with

¹ astonishment. King William designed to have endowed

this Monastery with lands sufficient for one hundred and
forty monks, but was prevented by death. However, he
granted many privileges to it, as exemption from epis-
copal jurisdiction, treasure-trove, and free warren in all
their lands3 all which privileges, with the Abbey itself,
coming into the King's hands at the Dissolution, he soon
after bestowed the site of the church,l with several of
the lands, upon one Gilmer, who, for lucre of the land,
timber, &c.‚ in a little time pulled it down and sold the

¹ Which was dedicated to the Holy Trinity‚ the Virgin Mary,
and St. Martin the Confessor.
