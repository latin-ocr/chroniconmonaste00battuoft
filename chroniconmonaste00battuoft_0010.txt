vi PREFAGE. τ

Mr. Petrie‚ on more mature consideration, would have
retained such emendations, had he lived to finish his
work.¹ With this brief statement we may now proceed
to make some observations on the Chronicle before us.

It commences with the Battle of Hastings, and extends
to the year 1176—an era of the utmost importance in
the annals of English Monasticism. The great struggle
between the two powers of the Church (the prelacy and
the religious orders) dates itself from this period, and the
dawning of that emancipation from Episcopal interference,
which was fully consummated by the latter under Inno-

With this power and influence of the Bishops grew
the power and wealth of the Religious F oundations3 for,
